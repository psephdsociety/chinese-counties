# chinese-counties

This project aims at developing python scripts to retrieve information on Chinese administrative divisions, so as to retrace their histories.
Goals :
- list of administrative divisions at province-, prefecture- and county-level, with an increasing timespan (say, for a reasonable objective, 2000-present).
- geolocative data on administrative boundaries of current divisions (and past, if possible).
- political economy data on local governments.
